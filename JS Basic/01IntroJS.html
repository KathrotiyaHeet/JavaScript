    <h1>Introduction To JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>JavaScript</b> => JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages
        alive”.
      </li>
      <li>The programs in this language are called scripts.</li>
      <li>
        They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as
        the page loads.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special
        preparation or compilation to run.
      </li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why is it Called JavaScript?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server,
        or actually on any device that has a special program called the
        JavaScript engine.
      </li>
      <li>
        The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript
        virtual machine”.
      </li>
      <li>Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
        <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
        <li>
          There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
          “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.</li>
      <li>React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.</li>
      <li>Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).</li>
      <li>Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.</li>
      <li>Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).</li>
    </ul>
